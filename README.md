It's springtime! And it's time to start thinking about how to plan your garden. For this app, allow the user to create a series of flower beds with rows of flowers where they can select the type and color for each row. Each bed should be on its own screen and allow the user to swipe between screens/beds. Each bed can have up to five rows. For the flower color, allow them to use the color picker to select the exact shade they planted.
